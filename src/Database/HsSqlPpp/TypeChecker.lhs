This is the public module for the type checking functionality.

> {- | Contains the data types and functions for annotating
>  an ast and working with annotated trees, including the
>  representations of SQL data types.
>
> Annotations:
>
> * are attached to most of the ast node data types, but not quite all of them;
>
> * types annotations are attached to most nodes during type checking;
>
> * type errors are attached to the lowest down node that the type
>   error is detected at;
>
> * nodes who fail the type check or whose type depends on a node with
>   a type error are given the type 'TypeCheckFailed';
>
> * each statement has an additional 'StatementInfo' annotation attached to it;
>
> * the parser fills in the source position annotation in every
>   annotatable ast node.
